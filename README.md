# ChessboardNg

ChessboardNg is a (working!) Angular wrap for chessboardjs library (display chessboard) and chessjs library (move validation).
It can be used as a good starting point for your angular chess web app.


Clone the project (https://github.com/pbaioni/ChessboardNg.git), open a terminal and navigate to the root folder of the cloned project.
Run the 'npm install' command and then 'ng serve'.
Open a browser and navigate to 'http://localhost:4200/' you should see a basic layout for your draggable chessboard.
