# ChessboardNg

ChessboardNg is an Angular wrap for chessboardjs and chess.js javascript libraries. It can be used as a good starting point for your angular chess web app. It provides a draggable chessboard with legal moves validation. All the chessboardjs and chess.js API are available in the "chessboard" component, ready to be used if needed.

Clone the project (https://github.com/pbaioni/ChessboardNg.git), open a terminal and navigate to the root folder of the cloned project. Run the 'npm install' command and then 'ng serve'. Open a browser and navigate to 'http://localhost:4200/' you should see a basic layout for your chessboard.
